# JavaScript DSA Journey

Hi developers
This repository documents my step-by-step journey of learning  
**Data Structures & Algorithms** using **JavaScript**.

Here, I don’t just study theory. I focus on:

- how to think algorithmically
- how to approach and solve problems
- and how to handle real interview-style questions

This is a practical learning log, not just a collection of notes.

## My Goal

As a frontend developer, my goals are to:

- develop strong algorithmic thinking
- prepare for technical interviews
- deeply understand JavaScript fundamentals
- write clean, efficient, and optimized code

---

## Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (used only to run examples locally)
- Git & GitHub

---

## What I’m Learning

Each topic lives in its own folder and usually contains:

1. `theory.md` — short and clear explanations
2. `examples.js` or `problems.js` — practical, hands-on code

### Roadmap:

- Big O Notation
- Arrays & Strings
- Recursion
- Stack & Queue
- HashMap & Set
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
